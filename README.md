# movie recommand-system
This project has done by matrix factorization using stochastic gradient descent.
So factorize the matrix of users vs movie-rating into users vs movie genres and movieId vs genres matrix.
And then each time update both factorize matrix using stochastic gradient descent so we get global minimum point. so it remain constant. and finally multiply this matrix we get userId vs movieId rating.
